### To run trento with the parameters specefied in the .conf file and to write the std output that has eccentricities, multiplicities for each event to a file,
> trento -c pbpbMAP.conf --output events >> trento_MAP_grad.txt

Because the files produced by Trento tend to take too much space you should delete the events folder as soon as the run is finished. We do not use the actual trento profiles to calculate the $\rho$
