To do for Dan
1. Why the Nan's are there in the observables for some design points? (13 points)
2. There were some events where we had more than 108 events or less than 108 events per design points. What is going on there?
3. Check dmin^3 prior. Are we setting prior for dmin or dmin^3.
4. Update the SDK document with VAH
5. Check if the experimental data I have in the vah folder is same as Dereks experimental data.
6. Try runnning the privateband rhic with emulators from vah and get corner plots

1. Get a single design and run 100,200,...2000 in sequance to see how sd of calculated observables
change with number of events per design. Identify how many events we need to get something
that can be compared with experimental observation error.

2. Fill in the SDK document

3. Put 5 rst files in privateband explaning each part of our work. Also migrate things in
observable repo to privateband because we will be able to publish it later with the paper.
